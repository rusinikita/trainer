## Why

I am a mentor. I looked for a way to automate basic help, so I decided to create a single app with interview questions and learning instructions.

Use it to:
- Prepare to GoLang tech interview section
- Study concurrency
- Examine and teach other developers
- Have fun

It will help to improve results if you don't have enough experience in concurrency and interviews.

It complements well with:
- ChatGPT/WizzardLM prompts [for CV editing to XYZ format](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts#act-as-a-recruiter), [position brainstorming](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts#act-as-a-talent-coach),
and [interviewer simulation](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts#act-as-position-interviewer)
- [Interview warmup AI](https://grow.google/certificates/interview-warmup/)

## Features

### 8 real interview challenges

Tutorial and 8 reworked challenges from my experience as an interviewer and candidate.

### Complex questions

It isn't about "program output". Many answers are bounded to code lines.

- Guess program output
- Find problems in code
- Offer a fix
