## Future idea

### Question with modified code 

Add ability to modify code sample by few code lines.
Allow questions with custom code: what if make(chan int)/remove/move

### Back to list button after challenge finished

### History

9 challenges now. Time to save completed

## Feedback 3

- I need to return back to challenge list
- I need to know what to do if I don't understand problem/code
- I don't understand that code had been copied to clipboard
- I don't know why 'N' not working. Keyboard input with not english layout
- I can't understand how to make challenge

### Changes

1. [ ] Return button
2. [ ] Unknown input layout feedback
3. [x] Code copy additional message
4. [ ] Add contribution readme
5. [x] Add challenge learning instructions component

Problem: wrong list render on learning info open and close
Solution: custom help component, setList size in View after footer and help render
